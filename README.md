# The Pizza Task (Frontend)

This is the source for the following [page](https://thepizzatask-fe.herokuapp.com/)

## Structure

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project and the [Backend](https://github.com/Gohchi/thepizzatask-be) are deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).


### Page content

- products: shows all the pizzas.
- orders: shows all the previous orders.
- contactinfo: just the first time on a new order, it ask for contact info.
- confirm: shows the cart with the details.

### Source info

This repo is a second version. The first one had a problem with the deployment. Due to the short time I decided to create a new one (this repo) with a clean working Heroku implementation.

You can check the previous version at [this repo](https://github.com/Gohchi/ThePizzaTaskFE) to see the old commits.
